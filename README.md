# Splunk Infolbox TIDE Threat Lookup tool
## Infoblox TIDE
Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice, about an existing
or emerging threat or hazard. It can be used to inform decisions regarding the subjectâ€™s response to that threat or hazard. Threats can come from
internal as well as external sources, and can come in the form of malicious IP addresses, hostnames, domain names and URLs.

TIDE is available as part of ActiveTrust Suite. Infoblox ActiveTrust Suite uses highly accurate machine-readable threat intelligence data via a
flexible and open Threat Intelligence Data Exchange (TIDE) platform to aggregate, curate, and enable distribution of data across a broad range of
infrastructures.

TIDE enables organizations to ease consumption of threat intelligence from various internal and external sources, and to effectively defend
against and quickly respond to threats.
